# Quest Quantum Hub Lab Module for OpenEMR

The Quest Quantum Hub module will allow for a bi-directional or HL7 results-only interface
with Quest Quantum Hub.
The module is a seamless integration with the existing interface.
The current interface will be used as usual. The module talks with Quest through a
series of API calls to their hub. The Quest Hub will auto-generate a requisition
form for each order. The requisition feature can be disabled in the config if not desired.
PDF results will be retrieved manually through the Quest user portal.

# Getting Started
The use of this module does require that Quest is contacted before enabling this module. Quest will
contact our office to schedule the turn-up of this module.
