# Quest Quantum Hub Lab Module for OpenEMR

The Quest Quantum Hub module will allow for a bi-directional or HL7 results only interface
with Quest Quantum Hub.
The module is a seamless integration with the existing interface.
The current interface will be used as normal. The module talks with Quest through a
series of API calls to their hub. The Quest Hub will auto-generate a requisition
form for each order. The requisition feature can be disabled in the config if not desired.
PDF results will be retrieved manually through the Quest user portal.

# Getting Started
The use of this module does require that Quest is contacted prior to enabling this module. Quest will
contact our office to schedule the turn up of this module.
